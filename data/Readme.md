   -  Link: [NIH Data](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC)
   -  12,000+ frontal-view X-ray images (14 diseases)
   -  Use the ‚ÄúNo Finding‚Äù images for training your VAE

2. RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge (Kaggle)
   -  Link: [RSNA Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data)
   -  Chest X-rays labeled for pneumonia or not

3. Tuberculosis Chest X-ray Dataset
   -  Link: [Tuberculosis Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/tuberculosis-chest-xray-dataset)
   -  Small dataset (~800 images), good for testing
   -  Make sure images are cleaned and resized to 64x64 if needed.
